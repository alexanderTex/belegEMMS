Functions and types that the G\-L\-S\-L specification doesn't define, but useful to have for a C++ program. Experimental extensions are useful functions and types, but the development of their A\-P\-I and functionality is not necessarily stable. They can change substantially between versions. Backwards compatibility is not much of an issue for them.

Even if it's highly unrecommended, it's possible to include all the extensions at once by including $<$\hyperlink{ext_8hpp_source}{glm/ext.\-hpp}$>$. Otherwise, each extension needs to be included a specific file.
